Backstory As a native Nashvillian, it&amp;rsquo;s been a wild ride watching the city change. Nashville&amp;rsquo;s population is growing by about 100 people a day!
With all these people has also come an increased load on the city&amp;rsquo;s transportation infrastructure. When I was commuting to work every day I found myself getting stuck in traffic multiple times a week due to wrecks, stalled vehicles, or events in town.</description>

      <title>Pitch Detection in iOS 4.x</title>

      <description>Before getting started This is a post I made back on the website I had while in college. That site has since been abandoned (sorry about that), but since I&amp;rsquo;ve started a new one I thought I&amp;rsquo;d import this here for legacy purposes. There are other open source pitch detection projects out there now using more modern language constructs and I&amp;rsquo;d recommend checking those out before this.
Pitch detection is a relatively common thing to do in the audio realm.</description>
